# Celestial calendar

![screenshot](https://github.com/MalloryWittwer/planetary-calendar/blob/master/public/screenshot.png?raw=true)

The prototype of a calendar app (demo available [here](https://mallorywittwer.github.io/planetary-calendar/)) that represents the passing of time based on the position of the Earth relative to the Sun, or of the Moon relative to the Earth (basically a calendar app for astro-geeks ðŸ‘¾).

Feel free to reach me at ðŸ“© mallory.wittwer@gmail.com if you find this project interesting and would like to contribute to it! There are many possible ways to improve the concept, visual design, and functionality.
